# LaPnP

This is the source code for our paper "Radio Map Estimation via Latent Domain Plug-and-Play Denoising". You can start by running the demo code.

Remember to cite our paper [1] if you use the code.

## Requirements

LaPnP plugs in exsisting denoisers as an update step. Following denoisers are used.

### BM3D

We have included the BM3D codes (matlab) in this repo, which downloads from https://webpages.tuni.fi/foi/GCF-BM3D/index.html. Please refer to [2] for BM3D denoiser.

### DRUnet

We have included the DRUnet codes in this repo, which downloads from https://github.com/cszn/DPIR. There are a few modifications to the original codes, as we need to call functions from Matlab. Please refer to [3] for more details.

- To run DRUnet, download the model "drunet_gray.pth" according to https://github.com/cszn/DPIR/blob/master/model_zoo/README.md, and put it in "Denoisers/DPIR-master/model_zoo/".

### DSG-NLM

It is implemented by ourselves in matlab. Please refer to [4] for details.
